## 30 Days
* Analyze code. Use time while analyzing it to improve documentation (e.g., data diagram, class diagrams and integration diagrams for the different components) and homogenize some components (re-factor some utils and make sure they are used).
* Try to reduce technological stack complexity isolating dependencies and reducing interconnections among the code. Favor agnostic core components wrapped in transforming functions to make them even more versatile (e.g., we can provide a CSV a JSON ready for mongoDB or even a Pandas DataFrame as result).
* Get to know team, identify needs and how the system can help fufilling them. Start prioritizing some of the needs.
* Get to know the community of contributors. Coordination methods (e.g., slack channels for coordinating efforts) and quality of code measures to be promoted.
* Get to know company culture (how do we coordinate, how do we help each other, how do we advanced in the same direction) and bureocratics.
* Get the research direction, what's the idea behind dissemination strategy. Identify potential publication points.
* Get up to speed with the state of the art.

## 60 days
* Start building some prototypes covering research/team needs detected.
* Start deploying some components on the cloud. Transform some functionalities to lambdas and services. Combine lambdas to provide higher value functionalities.
* Explore more advanced service orchestration/coordination.
* Deploy on the cloud when possible. Explore deployments for private cloud (AWS, Azure, etc.) and public cloud (terraform automated deployment and clusters of servers).
* Apply data-science knowledge to explore improvements for classifying methods. Tackle data-set imbalance and explore more specific classifiers combined via ensemble methods.

## 90 days
* Improve coordination on the different analysis services using semantic annotations and LLMs, so we can create complex analysis pipe-lines using natural language fine tuned to the domain where we apply the analysis.
* Generate a LLM fine-tuned for data analysis on chemical compound/protein docking.
* Explore a society of social and semantic aware agents able to autonomously coordinate services based on a semi-structured definition of an experiment to be performed.
* Collaborate with local research centers with expertise in cloud computing (e.g., Barcelona Supercomputing Center).
* Help mentoring possible masther/PhD students looking for interesting topics for masther and PhD thesis (the ideas outlined on the first 3 bullet points of this section have quite some potential).
